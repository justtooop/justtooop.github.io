IPCC on Global Warming

<p>
As announced in the International Panel on Climate Change held in Seoul in 2018, the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was approved by the IPCC, announcing that efforts will be made to reduce the detrimental effects that will be caused by Global Warming.
</p>
<h2 class="special">
What is Global Warming?
</h2>
<p>
Global warming is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. The major factors contributing to global warming are the enhanced greenhouse effect and the presence of particulate matter in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The enhanced greenhouse effect results when the greenhouse gases or particulate matter released from aerosols in the atmosphere absorb excessive heat in the form of infrared radiation radiating from Earth toward space. </p>
<p>There are 3 main processes that contribute to the enhanced greenhouse effect: <br>
1. Combustion. It produces carbon dioxide and water vapour. <br>
2. Life processes. Respiration and transpiration are forms of life processes. They produce water vapour and carbon dioxide. <br>
3. Decomposition. It causes an increase in the amount of methane and carbon dioxide in the air. <br>
All of the above processes produce gases like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane, which are considered to be common greenhouse gases.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, the main contributing greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. Thus, if we are able to limit the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, we are one step closer to defeating global warming.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=ei37rq" target="_blank"><img id="groupphoto2" src="http://i64.tinypic.com/ei37rq.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

<br>
Gases which do not absorb infrared radiation would undergo symmetric stretching of the gas molecule. The absorption of infrared radiation would cause the molecule of a greenhouse gas to vibrate in terms of the asymmetric stretching and bending of the covalent bonds of the gas. Thus, if asymmetric stretching occurs, the gas hence has the property to absorb infrared radiation, therefore being a greenhouse gas.
</p>

<h2 class="special">
How do we head towards a Sustainable Future?
</h2>
<p>
Photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide into sustainable hydrocarbon fuels is our answer. Our strategy reduces carbon dioxide, a main contributing greenhouse gas, into a sustainable fuel, methanol. The basis of this strategy is the utilisation of abundant and sustainable sunlight.<br>
We used Carbon Quantum Dots, a new member of the carbon nanomaterials family, to anchor this Sustainable Future.

Synthesis of Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
We found three ways to synthesize carbon quantum dots. <br>
1. Chemical Ablation <br>
We used strong oxidizing acids to carbonize small organic molecules to carbonaceous materials. These can be further cut into small sheets by controlled oxidation. We then synthesized carbon quantum dots in an aqueous solution by dehydrating carbohydrates with concentrated sulfuric acid, followed by breaking the carbonaceous materials into individual carbon quantum dots with nitric acid, and finally passivating with amine-terminated compounds.
</p>

<p>
2. Electrolysis <br>
We prepared the electrolyte of the electrochemical process by mixing ethanol with sodium hydroxide.
<br>
<br>
By using graphite rods as both anode and cathode, we synthesized the carbon quantum dots with a current intensity in the range of 10–200 mA cm<sup>2</sup>.
<br>
<br>
We found the rate of production of CQDs to be about 10 mg per hour for each setup.
<br>
Carbon quantum dots are to be separated by column chromatography. 
<br>
<br>
We treated the raw carbon quantum dots solution by adding a suitable amount of magnesium sulfate (5–7 wt%). After stirring for 20 minutes, we stored the reaction mixture for 24 hours to remove the salts and water. <br>
Afterwards, we separated the purified CQDs solution by silica-gel column chromatography with a mixture of petroleum ether and diethyl ether as the developing solvent.<br>
</p>

<p>
3. Laser ablation <br>
We carried out laser ablation of a carbon target in the presence of water vapour with argon as a carrier gas at 900 °C and 75 kPa to synthesize the carbon quantum dots. After refluxing in HNO<sub>3</sub> for 12 hours and passivating the surface by attaching simple organic species such as PEG1500N, we obtained the carbon quantum dots.
</p>

<h2 class="date">29 August 2036</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Best Method to synthesize Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
We found out that:
<br>
Laser ablation has a simple experimental setup but has low yield. <br>
Chemical ablation has large-scale production but involves toxic reagents. <br>
Electrolysis has large-scale production and the synthesis is also eco-friendly. <br>
</p>
<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2s61u37" target="_blank"><img id="groupphoto3" src="http://i64.tinypic.com/2s61u37.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>
<p>
Hence, we believe that electrolysis is the best way to synthesize the carbon quantum dots.
</p>


<h2 class="date">24 November 2036</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Ideal size of Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
We discovered that some carbon quantum dots did not have its ideal size and shape. Thus, we had to uncover a method to deal with this problem. 
<br>
<br>
To alter the size of the carbon quantum dots, we used confined pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition and is irreversible.

Production of Fuels by Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=10nrjvc" target="_blank"><img id="groupphoto4" src="http://i66.tinypic.com/10nrjvc.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>
<br>
We discovered that carbon quantum dots are very effective. Carbon quantum dots can produce biofuels efficiently as there is no limitation imposed by photovoltaic or photosynthetic efficiency. Thus, every photon that strikes the quantum dot produces an excited electron. This photosynthetic process first catalyzes the removal of hydrogen from water, followed by separating carbon from carbon dioxide to produce methanol as the end product in a continuous flow process by carbon dioxide hydrogenation. 
<br>
<br>
We found out that carbon Dioxide and hydrogen will be converted in methanol and water due to carbon dioxide hydrogenation.
</p>

<h2 class="date">23 September 2039</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Production of Fuels by Titanium Dioxide
</h2>
<p>
Research shows that electrochemical reduction technique is an effective method to produce methanol, but it can only attain low efficiencies due to deactivation of electrodes when converting CO<sub>2</sub>. Also, this process requires electrical energy. Thus, we hypothesize that fuels derived out of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in combination with water should be feasible by employing photocatalytic semiconductors, like titanium dioxide, which can utilise solar energy for this endothermic carbon dioxide conversion.
</p>

<h2 class="date">2 February 2040</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Potential of embedding Carbon Quantum Dots into Titanium Dioxide
</h2>
<p>
We conducted test to find out that carbon quantum dots has excellent photoluminescence property, light harvesting capability and effective electron-transport ability. With such properties, it is capable of serving as an excellent photocatalyst.
</p>
<p>
After long hours of research, we realised that the highest efficiency can be obtained by embedding carbon quantum dots into titanium dioxide.<br>
Since titanium dioxide catalyses the electrochemical reduction reaction, more carbon dioxide can be converted to methanol, on top of the products from the reaction catalysed by carbon quantum dots! <br>
With both catalytic reactions, the overall efficiency of the system is increased.
</p>
<p>
We synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub>/CQDs nanocomposites by a typical sol–gel method. The procedure is as follows:
<br>Firstly, for TiO<sub>2</sub>/CQDs, tetrabutyl titanate (0.5 mL) was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and then water (9 mL) and ammonia (5 mL; 28%) were added with stirring. 
<br>Next, the mixture is then left to age for 12 hours. The samples are later collected by centrifugation and dried in an oven at 80 for 6 hours. TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were prepared by calcining the above sample at 500°C for 1 hour. 
<br>Finally, TiO<sub>2</sub>nanoparticles (0.05–0.1 g) was added to CQDs solution (5 mL), forming the TiO<sub>2</sub>/CQDs nanoparticles.
</p>

<h2 class="date">4 April 2044</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Sustainability of Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
We optimised the synthesis of carbon quantum dots extensively over the carbon quantum dots over the recent years. We also characterised the carbon quantum dots. This is due to the increasing need to develop synthesis solutions for CQDs applications to allow simple and cheap applications with composite materials.
</p>
<p>
We used a one-pot carbon quantum dots reaction in an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution and the synthesis of transparent UV protection films is presented. The synthesis solution was tuned in a way that transparent UV-protection films cast from unpurified CQDs–PVA solutions could be obtained without the need of yield consuming purification steps.
</p>
<p>
Measuring the impact of varying PVA, branched polyethylene imine (b-PEI), and citric acid (CA) concentrations on the solution's and film's UV/Vis transmission and absorbance allowed elucidating important factors influencing the solution to film property transition. Applying CQDs–PVA films on commercially available PET bottle films resulted in high transparency of the composite film in the visible range (>80%) and UV absorption of over 90%. Lastly, our CQDs–PVA film performed stable UV-blocking and did not show any bleaching effects over several days of UV-exposure.

Effectiveness of Carbon Quantum Dots
</h2>
<p>
We discovered that carbon Quantum Dots are able to reduce carbon dioxide by up to 90% and convert 45% into sustainable biofuels.
</p>

<h2 class="date">3 February 2046</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Cost of Producing Carbon Quantum Dots and Titanium Dioxide
</h2>
<p>
The cost of producing CQDs is relatively cheap as an ultrahigh CQDs yield of 76.9 wt % can be obtained for each batch of synthesis
</p>
<p>
Commercial price of titanium dioxide is around $2/kg.
</p>
<p>
As a result, a combination of these would be cheap to produce.
</p>

<h2 class="date">7 March 2046</h2>
<h2 class="special">
Sustainability of Strategy
</h2>
<p>
Carbon is one of the most abundant resources we have on earth.
</p>
<p>
We are able to synthesise carbon quantum dots in an environmentally-friendly manner as we do not make use of any environmentally-toxic chemicals.
</p>
<p>
On top of this, TiO<sub>2</sub> is very easily reproducible at industrial levels.

Scale of Adoption

<p>
In order to fully maximise the potential of carbon quantum dots, we have drawn up a basic industrial model for adoption as shown above.
<br>
<br>
It takes in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and obtains carbon dioxide through methods such as seawater capture where carbon dioxide is obtained from seawater. These can be implemented in factories, to prevent the release of carbon dioxide from combustion into the atmosphere. It will not take up a large space in the factories, thus not posing much of a threat.
